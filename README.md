Here is my first web development project -a responsive landing page! This project helped me strengthen my knowledge of HTML and CSS by applying key concepts like adding columns, arranging sections, creating headers and footers, and ensuring a visually appealing layout.

Special thanks to Oasis Infobyte for the opportunity to learn and grow through this internship. Excited for more to come!
